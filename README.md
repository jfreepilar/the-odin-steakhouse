The Odin Steakhouse (Landing Page)

This project involves applying the skills acquired from past lessons in The Odin Project. The goal is to create and design a landing page for a website. Some sections of the landing page contain dummy content, and to enhance the page's appearance, I opted to replace them with images and designs, making the landing page resemble an official restaurant website.

Skills on Display:
1. Basic Git Workflow - Demonstrating the ability to create a repository on GitHub, clone it onto my computer, make changes to the project via local files, and then commit and push them using Git commands in my terminal.

2. HTML - Utilizing elements, tags, hrefs, and understanding the relationship between parent and child elements.

3. CSS Layout - Positioning elements on the viewport to match the sample layout and understanding the relationship between each element, including margin and padding.

This project can be overwhelming, especially for beginners like me. My approach to this project is breaking it down into smaller sections, mirroring how professionals tackle large-scale projects.
